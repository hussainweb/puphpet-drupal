# PuPHPet for Drupal

This is a Vagrantfile template based on PuPHPet with some modifications. PuPHPet is pretty decent at running Drupal at the outset but that doesn't mean we can't make a few tweaks:

* Changed .gitattributes file to correctly handle .png and other binary files.
* Change drush to latest 7.0.0-alpha5 version (PuPHPet lists only upto alpha3).
